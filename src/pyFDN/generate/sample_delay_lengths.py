    Targets are drawn within ``delay_range`` according to ``distribution`` and,

    integers. A local :class:`numpy.random.Generator` is used so passing an
    integer seed (or generator) makes the result reproducible without touching
    NumPy's global random state.

    Args:
        N: Number of delay lines.
        delay_range: Inclusive ``(low, high)`` range in samples.
        distribution: Sampling distribution for the delay lengths:

            * ``"uniform"`` – flat in linear space.
            * ``"geometric"`` – flat in log space (log-uniform), i.e.
              geometrically spaced with equal probability per octave.
            * ``"lognormal"`` – Gaussian in log space, centred on the
              geometric mean of the range. The range span roughly ±2 sigma.

        coprime: When ``True``, snap the sampled values to the nearest distinct,
            pairwise-coprime integers. Coprime delays avoid coinciding echoes
            and degenerate modes; snapping may nudge values slightly outside
            ``delay_range``.
        sort: Sort the returned delays in ascending order.
        rng: Local NumPy generator or integer seed.

    Returns:
        Integer array of shape ``(N,)`` with the delay lengths in samples.
