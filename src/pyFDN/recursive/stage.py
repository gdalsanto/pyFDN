    """
    Abstract base class for a processing stage in a recursive DSP system.

    Each stage represents one block-processing operation that can read from and write to:
    - lines: Feedback-line signals tensor for the current block (local to this block)
    - state_t: Global state dictionary at the start of the block (read-only)
    - next_state: Accumulating state updates for the next block (write-only for owned keys)

    Stages operate on blocks of audio with consistent tensor shapes:
    - B: batch size
    - T: time samples in block
    - N: number of feedback lines/channels
    - N_in: number of input channels
    - N_out: number of output channels

        Process one block of audio.

        This method should:
        1. Read any needed signals from `lines`, `x_block` and `state_t`
        2. Perform processing
        3. Return updated `lines` and (optionally) an output block `y_block`

        Args:
            lines: Feedback-line signals for this block, shape [B, N, T].
                   May be None for the first stage (e.g. `DelayRead`) which
                   is responsible for creating the initial lines tensor.
            state_t: Global state at start of block (read-only, do not modify)
            next_state: Accumulating state updates (write only your owned keys)

                     `OutputTap` with direct paths) need to read this.

                - `new_lines` is the updated feedback-line tensor [B, N, T]

                  (typically produced only by `OutputTap`-like stages)

            - You may read any entry from `state_t`
            - You may only write to `next_state` keys listed in `self.state_keys`
