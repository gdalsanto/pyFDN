    Abstract base class for a processing stage in a recursive DSP system.
    
    Each stage represents one block-processing operation that can read from and write to:
    - ctx: Signal context dictionary for the current block (local to this block)
    - state_t: Global state dictionary at the start of the block (read-only)
    - next_state: Accumulating state updates for the next block (write-only for owned keys)
    
    Stages operate on blocks of audio with consistent tensor shapes:
    - B: batch size
    - T: time samples in block
    - N: number of feedback lines/channels
    - N_in: number of input channels
    - N_out: number of output channels
