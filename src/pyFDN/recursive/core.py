    Coordinator for recursive DSP processing using a sequence of stages.

    This class manages:

    - Ordered list of processing stages

            InputTap(...),          # inject external input into lines

            ...                     # (optional additional processing on lines)
            DelayWrite(...),        # write updated lines back to delay buffers
            OutputTap(...),         # produce final output from lines (+ optional direct path)
